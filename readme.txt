ARDicee is an AR iOS app that allows you to set multiple dice on an AR plane and roll them.

To add a 🎲 on the plane simply tap 👆🏻 on the plane that shows up on the screen.

To roll all dice you can press the roll all button 🔄 on the top-right corner of the app OR you can shake 💃🏻 the device for some extra ✨flair✨!

To remove all dice from the AR World press the trash button 🗑 on the top-left corner.

Enjoy rolling your dice and testing your luck! 🍀
